  <title>Enter special characters</title>

  <p>You can enter and view thousands of characters from most of the world's
  writing systems, even those not found on your keyboard. This page lists
  some different ways you can enter special characters.</p>

  <section id="charmap">
    <title>Character map</title>
    <p>Endless comes with a character map application that allows you to browse
    all the characters in Unicode. Use the character map to find the character
    you want, and then copy and paste it to wherever you need it.</p>

    <p>You can find <app>Character Map</app> in the <gui>Activities</gui>
    overview. For more information on the character map, see the
    <link href="help:gucharmap">Character Map Manual</link>.</p>

  <section id="compose">
    <title>Compose key</title>
    <p>A compose key is a special key that allows you to press multiple keys
    in a row to get a special character. For example, to type the accented
    letter <em>é</em>, you can press <key>compose</key> then <key>'</key>
    then <key>e</key>.</p>
    <p>Keyboards don't have specific compose keys. Instead, you can define
    one of the existing keys on your keyboard as a compose key.</p>

    <steps>
      <title>Define a compose key</title>
      <item>
        <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-terminology">Activities</gui> overview and
        start typing <gui>Keyboard</gui>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Click on <gui>Keyboard</gui> to open the panel.</p>
      </item>
      <item><p>Select the <gui>Shortcuts</gui> tab and click
      <gui>Typing</gui>.</p></item>
      <item><p>Click on <gui>Compose Key</gui> in the right pane.</p></item>
      <item><p>Click on <gui>Disabled</gui> and select the key you would like to
      behave as a compose key from the drop-down menu. You can choose either of
      the <key>Ctrl</key> keys, the right <key>Alt</key> key, the right
      <key>Win</key> or <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key if
      you have one, the <key xref="keyboard-key-menu">Menu</key> key or
      <key>Caps Lock</key>. Any key you select will then only work as a compose
      key, and will no longer work for its original purpose.</p></item>
    </steps>
    <p>You can type many common characters using the compose key, for
    example:</p>
    <list>
      <item><p>Press <key>compose</key> then <key>'</key> then a letter to
      place an acute accent over that letter, such as <em>é</em>.</p></item>
      <item><p>Press <key>compose</key> then <key>`</key> (back tick) then a
      letter to place a grave accent over that letter, such as
      <em>è</em>.</p></item>
      <item><p>Press <key>compose</key> then <key>"</key> then a letter to
      place an umlaut over that letter, such as <em>ë</em>.</p></item>
      <item><p>Press <key>compose</key> then <key>-</key> then a letter to
      place a macron over that letter, such as <em>ē</em>.</p></item>
    </list>
    <p>For more compose key sequences, see <link
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key#Common_compose_combinations">the
    compose key page on Wikipedia</link>.</p>

<section id="ctrlshiftu">
  <title>Code points</title>

  <p>You can enter any Unicode character using only your keyboard with the
  numeric code point of the character. Every character is identified by a
  four-character code point. To find the code point for a character, find the
  character in the character map application and look in the status bar or the
  <gui>Character Details</gui> tab. The code point is the four characters after
  <gui>U+</gui>.</p>

  <p>To enter a character by its code point, hold down <key>Ctrl</key> and
  <key>Shift</key>, type <key>U</key> followed by the four-character code
  point, then release <key>Ctrl</key> and <key>Shift</key>. If you often use
  characters that you can't easily access with other methods, you might find
  it useful to memorize the code point for those characters so you can enter
  them quickly.</p>

  <section id="layout">
    <title>Keyboard layouts</title>
    <p>You can make your keyboard behave like the keyboard for another language,
    regardless of the letters printed on the keys. You can even easily switch
    between different keyboard layouts using an icon in the top bar. To learn
    how, see <link xref="keyboard-layouts"/>.</p>
  </section>

<section id="im">
  <title>Input methods</title>

  <p>An Input Method expands the previous methods by allowing to enter
  characters not only with keyboard but also any input devices. For instance
  you could enter characters with a mouse using a gesture method, or enter
  Japanese characters using a Latin keyboard.</p>

  <p>To choose an input method, right-click over a text widget, and in the menu
  <gui>Input Method</gui>, choose an input method you want to use. There is no
  default input method provided, so refer to the input methods documentation to
  see how to use them.</p>
