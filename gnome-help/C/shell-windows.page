<title>Windows</title>

  <p>Like other desktops, Endless uses windows to display your running
  applications. You can launch new applications and control active windows.</p>
<!-- 
  <p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, the <gui>dash</gui> displays your 
  favorite applications as well as your running applications. 
  The <gui>dash</gui> will place a slight glow behind any running applications.
  </p>
      
  <p>Clicking the application icon will launch it if it is not running.  
  If it is already running, clicking the application will open the last used 
  window of that application.</p>

  <p>Right clicking the application icon for a running application will 
  bring all windows for that application forward. A menu with the titles of your
  windows will be displayed. You can select a window from this menu. It also 
  provides options to open a new window for that application and to remove or 
  add that application to favorites depending on its current status.</p>

  <p>Windows are shown on their corresponding 
  <link xref="shell-windows-workspaces">workspaces</link>.</p>
-->
<comment><p>Briefly explain the different window states that exist and how you
can use and recognize those states. Discuss interesting ways of arranging windows
(i.e. if there is a "Tile" option or something like that). Mention, in passing,
how you can move and resize windows in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Very brief overview of what you can do with windows. Link to relevant topics.</p>
