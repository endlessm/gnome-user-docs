<title>Connect to a hidden wireless network</title>

<p>Hidden networks don't show up in the list of wireless networks. Having a
hidden network makes it harder for other people to find it, and so more likely
to be secure. To connect to a hidden wireless network follow the steps:</p>

<steps>
  <item>
    <p>Click the network icon on the task bar and select
    <gui>NetworkSettings.</gui></p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Click the <gui>Connect to Hidden Network</gui> button.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>In the window that appears, type the network name and choose the type
    of wireless security from the Wi-Fi security drop-down list.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Enter the password or other security details.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>Click Connect.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

  <p>You may have to check the settings of the wireless access point or router
  to see what the network name is. If you don't have the network name (SSID),
  you can use the <em>BSSID</em> (Basic Service Set Identifier, the access
  point's MAC address), which looks something like <gui>02:00:01:02:03:04</gui>
  and can usually be found on the underside of the access point.</p>

  <p>You should also check the security settings for the wireless access point.
  Look for terms like WEP and WPA.</p>

<note>
 <p>While hiding your network may help improve security by preventing people who
 don't know about it from connecting, the network will still remain detectable.
 You may want to take additional precautionary measures to further safeguard
 your network.</p>
