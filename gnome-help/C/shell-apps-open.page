<p>If an app is running, it's focused. You can create a new window by dragging
to the windows overview or onto a workspace thumbnail. (Also mention dragging
to overview in list item below, not just workspace thumbnail.) Right-click
icon to choose a window to focus or get new window. Mention middle-click?</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">If you are not on the desktop, select
  the <gui>Applications</gui> button on the left side of the top bar to return
  to the desktop. This is where you can find all of your applications. You can
  also open the desktop by pressing the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> +
  <key>A</key> keys. To open the activities overview press the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">You can start applications from the
  <gui xref="shell-introduction#activities">Applications</gui> menu at the top
  left of the screen, or you can use the desktop by pressing the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>

  <p>There are several ways of opening an application once you’re on the Dekstop</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Start typing the name of an application — searching begins instantly.
      (If this doesn’t happen, click the search bar at the top of the screen
      and start typing.) If you don’t know the exact name of an application, try
      to type an related term. Click the application’s icon to start it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Some applications have icons in the <em>dash</em>, the horizontal strip
      of icons at the bottom of the <gui>Activities</gui> overview.
      Click one of these to start the corresponding application.</p>
      <p>If you have applications that you use very frequently, you can
      <link xref="shell-apps-favorites">add them to the dash</link>
      yourself.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the grid button (which has nine dots) in the dash.
      You will see the first page of the desktop. To see more applications,
      press the dots at the bottom, above the dash, to view other applications
      or move your mouse cursor to the right-most side of the screen and select
      the arrow button that appears. Press on the application to start it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You can launch an application in a separate
      <link xref="shell-workspaces">workspace</link> by dragging its icon from
      the dash, and dropping it onto one of the workspaces. The application will
      open in the chosen workspace.</p>
      <p>You can launch an application in a <em>new</em> workspace by dragging its
      icon to an empty workspace, or to the small gap between two workspaces.</p>
    </item>
  </list>

<p>TODO: Recheck last item in list above after https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/3776
and https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1661 have been fixed in 40</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <title>Quickly running a command</title>
    <p>Another way of launching an application is to press
    <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, enter its
    <em>command name</em>, and then press the <key>Enter</key> key.</p>
    <p>For example, to launch <app>Rhythmbox</app>, press
    <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq> and type
    ‘<cmd>rhythmbox</cmd>’ (without the single-quotes). The name of the app is
    the command to launch the program.</p>
    <p>Use the arrow keys to quickly access previously run commands.</p>
