<p>If an app is running, it's focused. You can create a new window by dragging
to the windows overview or onto a workspace thumbnail. (Also mention dragging
to overview in list item below, not just workspace thumbnail.) Right-click
icon to choose a window to focus or get new window. Mention middle-click?</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Move your mouse pointer to the
  <gui>Activities</gui> corner at the top left of the screen to show the
  <gui>Activities</gui> overview. This is where you can find all of your
  applications. You can also open the overview by pressing the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>
  
  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">You can start applications from the
  <link xref="shell-terminology"><gui>Applications</gui> menu</link> at the top
  left of the screen, or you can use the <gui>Activities</gui> overview by
  pressing the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>

  <p>There are several ways of opening an application once you're in the
  <gui>Activities</gui> overview:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Start typing the name of an application - searching begins instantly.
      (If this doesn't happen, click the search bar at the top of the screen
      and start typing.) Click the application's icon to start it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Some applications have icons in the <em>dash</em>, the vertical strip
      of icons on the left-hand side of the <gui>Activities</gui> overview.
      Click one of these to start the corresponding application.</p>
      <p>If you have applications that you use very frequently, you can
      <link xref="shell-apps-favorites">add them to the dash</link>
      yourself.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click the grid button at the bottom of the dash. You will see the
      frequently used applications if the <gui style="button">Frequent</gui>
      view is enabled. If you want to run a new application, press the
      <gui style="button">All</gui> button at the bottom to view all the
      applications. Press on the application to start it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You can launch an application in a separate
      <link xref="shell-workspaces">workspace</link> by dragging its icon from
      the dash (or from the list of applications), and dropping it onto one of
      the workspaces on the right-hand side of the screen. The application will
      open in the chosen workspace.</p>
      <p>You can launch an application in a <em>new</em> workspace by
      middle-clicking its icon in the dash or in the application list.</p>
    </item>
  </list>

<note style="tip">
 <title>Quickly running a command</title>
  <p>Another way of launching an application is to press
  <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, enter its <em>command name</em>,
  and then press the <key>Enter</key> key.</p>
  <p>For example, to launch <app>Rhythmbox</app>, press
  <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq> and type 'rhythmbox' (without the
  single-quotes). The name of the app is the command to launch the program.</p>
