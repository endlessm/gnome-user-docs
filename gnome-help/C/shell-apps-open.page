  <title>Add apps, folders and website shortcuts</title>

  <p>Endless comes packed with great applications and resources for you to
  discover and explore. The pre-installed applications on your desktop are just
  a few of the many applications available to you. You now have access to
  everything from games, to educational applications, to valuable health
  resources, and much more.</p>

  <p>Below, you can learn how to add new apps, folders, and shortcuts to your
  favorite websites directly to your desktop.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click once on the <gui>More Apps</gui> button on the desktop.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>All of the applications you see are free. You can browse by category
      and read each application's short description until you find one that you
      want to install onto your desktop. When you find one you like, click on
      its name to read more about it, see screenshots and install.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To install an application simply click <gui>Install app</gui>. You will
      need an internet connection to download these applications.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Some applications are already downloaded to your computer and you can
      add them to your desktop by clicking <gui>Add to desktop</gui>. </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>When the application's installation is complete, the green button will
      change to <gui>Open app</gui> and you can start using the application
      immediately! </p>
      <p>The application's icon will also be installed on your desktop, to the
      left of the <gui>More Apps</gui> button. You can then move it wherever
      makes sense to you so you can find it easily.</p>

<note style="tip">
 <title>Quickly running a command</title>
  <p>Another way of launching an application is to press
  <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, enter its <em>command name</em>,
  and then press the <key>Enter</key> key.</p>
  <p>For example, to launch <app>Rhythmbox</app>, press
  <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq> and type 'rhythmbox' (without the
  single-quotes). The name of the app is the command to launch the program.</p>
