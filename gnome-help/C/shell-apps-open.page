<p>If an app is running, it's focused. You can create a new window by dragging
to the windows overview or onto a workspace thumbnail. (Also mention dragging
to overview in list item below, not just workspace thumbnail.) Right-click
icon to choose a window to focus or get new window. Mention middle-click?</p>

  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Click the <gui>Endless button</gui>
  at left corner of the taskbar to show the Desktop. This is where you
  can find all of your applications. You can also go to the Desktop by pressing
  the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>
  
  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">You can start applications from the
  <gui xref="shell-introduction#desktop">Applications</gui> menu at the top
  left of the screen, or you can use the <gui>Desktop</gui> by
  pressing the <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key.</p>

  <p>There are several ways of opening an application once you’re in the
  <gui>Desktop</gui>:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Start typing the name of an application — searching begins instantly.
      (If this doesn’t happen, click the search bar at the top of the screen
      and start typing.) If you don’t know the exact name of an application, try
      to type an related term. Click the application’s icon to start it.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Some applications have icons in the <em>Taskbar</em>, the horizontal strip
      of icons at the bottom of the <gui>Desktop</gui>.
      Click one of these to start the corresponding application.</p>
      <p>If you have applications that you use very frequently, you can
      <link xref="shell-apps-favorites">add them to the taskbar</link>
      yourself.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>When looking at the <gui>Desktop</gui>,
      you will see the first page of all installed applications. To see more
      applications, press the arrow on the right.
      Press on the application to start it.</p>
    </item>
  </list>

<p>TODO: Recheck last item in list above after https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/3776
and https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1661 have been fixed in 40</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <title>Quickly running a command</title>
    <p>Another way of launching an application is to press
    <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>, enter its
    <em>command name</em>, and then press the <key>Enter</key> key.</p>
    <p>For example, to launch <app>Rhythmbox</app>, press
    <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq> and type
    ‘<cmd>rhythmbox</cmd>’ (without the single-quotes). The name of the app is
    the command to launch the program.</p>
    <p>Use the arrow keys to quickly access previously run commands.</p>
