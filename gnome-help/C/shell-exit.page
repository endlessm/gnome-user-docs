  <p>More links would be good, especially in #logout. Could go final
  as-is. Incomplete for now</p>

  <p>When you have finished using your computer, you can turn it off or leave it
  powered on and log out.</p>

<section id="logout">
  <title>Log out or switch users</title>

  <p>To let other users use your computer, you can either log out, or leave
  yourself logged in and just switch users. If you switch users, all of
  your applications will continue running, and everything will be where you
  left it when you log back in.</p>
  <p>To log out (i.e. in order to switch to a different user), click
  the User Menu on the bottom left corner of your screen and then click the
  <gui>lock icon</gui>.</p>

</section>

<section id="lock-screen">
  <title>Lock the screen</title>

  <p>If you're leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
  screen to prevent other people from accessing your files or running
  applications. When you return, you'll need to enter your password to log back
  in. You will find your computer running all the same things it was when you
  left.</p>
  <p>To lock your screen, click on the User Menu at the very bottom
  left-hand side of your screen and press the <gui>Lock</gui> button at the
  bottom right of the menu.</p>

<note><p>If you don't lock your screen, it will lock automatically after a
certain amount of time, unless you disable that feature from the
<gui>Privacy</gui> section in <gui>Settings</gui>.</p></note>

</section>


<section id="shutdown">
<!--<info>

  <title>Power off or restart</title>

  <p>If you want to power off your computer entirely, or do a full restart,
  click the User Menu at the very bottom left-hand side of your screen and
  press the <gui>Exit</gui> button at the bottom right of the menu. A dialog will
  open offering you the options to, among other options, <gui>Restart</gui> or
  <gui>Power Off</gui>.</p>

  <p>If there are other users logged in, you may not be allowed to power off or
  restart the computer because this will end their sessions.  If you are an
  administrative user, you may be asked for your password to power off.</p>
