    <p>It's not possible to have a guest user in 3.10</p>
  </comment>

  <p>You can create a user account for guests, people who will only use the
  computer on a brief, temporary basis. The guest user will be able to use the
  programs on your computer, but they won't be able to access your files,
  change your settings, or install software.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Create a guest user account:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Click your name on the top bar, then click the picture next to your
      name to open the <gui>Users</gui> window.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Unlock</gui> in the top right corner and type your password
      to make changes. You must be an administrative user to add user
      accounts.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the list of accounts on the left, click the
      <gui style="button">+</gui> button to add a new user account.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select <gui>Standard</gui> for the account type. You don't want to
      give the guest account administrative access. Then give the account a
      name like <em>Guest</em>, or any other name you like. The username will
      be filled in automatically based on the full name. The default is
      probably OK, but you can change it if you like. Click <gui>Add</gui> when
      you're done.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the new guest user account. Under <gui>Login Options</gui>,
      click the label <gui>Account disabled</gui> next to <gui>Password</gui>.
      You will be presented with a window with password options. From the
      <gui>Action</gui> drop-down list, select <gui>Log in without a
      password</gui>.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <note>
    <p>Back in the <gui>User Accounts</gui> window you can click the image next
    to the user's name on the right to set an image for the account. This image
    will be shown in the login window. Endless provides some stock photos you can
    use, or you can select your own or take a picture with your webcam.</p>
