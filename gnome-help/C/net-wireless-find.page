<title>I can't see my wireless network on the list</title>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to see your wireless
 network on the list that appears when you click the network icon
 on the task bar.</p>

<list>
 <item>
  <p>If no networks are shown in the list, your wireless hardware could be
  turned off, or it may not be working properly. Make sure it is turned on.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>If there are lots of wireless networks nearby, the network you are looking
  for might not be on the first page of the list. If this is the case, look at
  the bottom of the list for "More" and an arrow pointing towards the right.
  Click "More" to see the rest of the wireless networks.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>You could be out of range of the network. Try moving closer to the
  wireless base station/router and see if the network appears in the list after
  a while.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>The list of wireless networks takes time to update. If you have just
  turned on your computer or moved to a different location, wait for a minute
  or so and then check if the network has appeared in the list.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>The network could be hidden. You need to

  hidden network.</p>
