  <title>Click and move mouse pointer using the keypad</title>

  <p>If you have difficulties using a mouse or other pointing device, you can
  control the mouse pointer using the numeric keypad on your keyboard. This
  feature is called <em>mouse keys</em>.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <gui xref="shell-terminology">Activities</gui> overview and
      start typing <gui>Universal Access</gui>.</p>
      <p>You can access the <gui>Activities</gui> overview by pressing on it,
      by moving your mouse pointer against the top-left corner of the screen,
      using <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq>
      followed by <key>Enter</key> or using
      <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Universal Access</gui> to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Use the up and down arrow keys to select <gui>Mouse Keys</gui> in the
      <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> section then press <key>Enter</key>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Make sure that <key>Num Lock</key> is turned off. You will now be able
      to move the mouse pointer using the keypad.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>The keypad is a set of numerical buttons on your keyboard, usually
  arranged into a square grid. If you have a keyboard without a keypad (such as
  a laptop keyboard), you may need to hold down the function (<key>Fn</key>)
  key and use certain other keys on your keyboard as a keypad. If you use this
  feature often on a laptop, you can purchase external USB or bluetooth numeric
  keypads.</p>

  <p>Each number on the keypad corresponds to a direction. For example,
  pressing <key>8</key> will move the pointer upwards and pressing
  <key>2</key> will move it downwards. Press the <key>5</key> key to click once
  with the mouse, or quickly press it twice to double-click.</p>

  <p>Most keyboards have a special key which allows you to right-click,
  sometimes called the <key xref="keyboard-key-menu">Menu</key> key. Note,
  however, that this key responds to where your keyboard focus is, not where
  your mouse pointer is. See <link xref="a11y-right-click"/> for information on
  how to right-click by holding down <key>5</key> or the left mouse button.</p>

  <p>If you want to use the keypad to type numbers while mouse keys is enabled,
  turn <key>Num Lock</key> on. The mouse cannot be controlled with the keypad
  when <key>Num Lock</key> is turned on, though.</p>

  <note>
    <p>The normal number keys, in a line at the top of the keyboard, will not
    control the mouse pointer. Only the keypad number keys can be used.</p>
