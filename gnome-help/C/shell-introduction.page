      <note style="tip">
        <p>The Endless OS desktop is a customized version of a desktop called “GNOME”. You will see the terms “Endless OS” and “GNOME” used interchangeably in this documentation.</p>
      </note>
      <p>Endless OS features a completely reimagined user interface designed to
      stay out of your way, minimize distractions, and help you get things done.
      When you first log in, you will see the <gui>desktop</gui> with the list of pre-installed 
      applications and the dash.</p>

  <p>The top bar provides access to your windows and applications, your
  calendar and appointments, and
  <link xref="status-icons">system properties</link> like sound, networking,
  and power. In the system menu in the top bar, you can change the volume or
  screen brightness, edit your <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> connection details, check your
  battery status, log out or switch users, and turn off your computer.</p>
    
  <p>If you have a screen that supports vertical or horizontal rotation, you can also
  quickly rotate the screen from the system menu. If your screen does not support rotation,
  you will not see the button.</p>

  the application is already running, it will have a small dot below its icon. 
  Clicking its icon will bring up the most recently used window. You can also 
  drag the icon onto a workspace.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:!gnome-classic, platform:endless">Right-clicking the
