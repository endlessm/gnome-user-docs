  <title>Recover a file from the Trash</title>

  <p>If you delete a file from your <app>Documents</app> folder, the file is
  normally placed into the <gui>Trash</gui>, and should be able to be
  restored.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To restore a file from the Trash:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Click on the <app>Documents</app> icon from the <gui>Desktop</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click <gui>Trash</gui> in the sidebar.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If your deleted file is there, click on it and select
      <gui>Restore</gui> near the top right of the window. The file will be
      restored to the folder from where it was deleted.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>If you deleted the file by pressing <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>Delete
  </key></keyseq>, or by using the command line, the file has been permanently
  deleted. Files that have been permanently deleted can't be recovered from the
  <gui>Trash</gui>.</p>

  <p>Add this when you can install things "There are a number of recovery tools
  available that are sometimes able to recover files that were permanently
  deleted. These tools are generally not very easy to use, however. If you
  accidentally permanently deleted a file, it's probably best to ask for advice
  on a support forum to see if you can recover it."</p>
