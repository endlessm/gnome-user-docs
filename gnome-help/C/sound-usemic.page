  <title>Use a different microphone</title>

  <p>You can use an external microphone for chatting with friends, speaking
  with colleagues at work, making voice recordings, or using other multimedia
  applications. Even if your computer has a built-in microphone or a webcam
  with a microphone, a separate microphone usually provides better audio
  quality.</p>

  <p>If your microphone has a circular plug, just plug it into the appropriate
  audio socket on your computer. Most computers have two sockets: one for
  microphones and one for speakers. This socket is usually light red in color
  or is accompanied by a picture of a microphone. Microphones plugged
  into the appropriate socket are usually used by default. If not, see the
  instructions below for selecting a default input device.</p>

  <p>If you have a USB microphone, plug it into any USB port on your
  computer. USB microphones act as separate audio devices, and you may
  have to specify which microphone to use by default.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>Select a default audio input device</title>
    <item>
      <p>Go to the <gui>desktop</gui> and start typing <gui>Sound</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Sound</gui> to open the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>In the <gui>Input</gui> section, select the device that you want to
      use. The input level indicator should respond when you speak.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>You can adjust the volume and switch the microphone off from this
  panel.</p>
