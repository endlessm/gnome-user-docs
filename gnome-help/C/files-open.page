<title>Open files with other applications</title>

<p>When you double-click a file in your documents folder, it will be opened with
the default application for that file type unless you choose another application to open it.</p>

<p>To open a file with an application other than the default one, right-click
the file, move your mouse to the "Open With" option, and choose the application
you want to open the file with. If you don't see the application you want in
that list, click <gui>Other Application...</gui>. The file manager only shows
applications it knows can handle the file.</p>

  <title>Change the default application</title>
  <p>You can change the default application that is used to open files of a
  given type. This will allow you to open your preferred application when you
  double-click to open a file. For example, you might want your favorite music
  player to open when you double-click an MP3 file.</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Select a file of the type whose default application you want to change.
    For example, to change which application is used to open MP3 files,
    select a <file>.mp3</file> file.</p></item>
    <item><p>Right-click the file and select <gui>Information</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select the <gui>Open With</gui> tab.</p></item>
    <item><p>Select the application you want and click <gui>Set as default</gui>.
    By default, the list only shows applications that can handle the
    file. To look through all the applications on your computer, click <gui>Show
    other applications</gui>.</p>
    <p>If <gui>Other Applications</gui> contains an application you sometimes
    want to use, but don't want to make the default, select that application and
    click <gui>Add</gui>. This will add it to <gui>Recommended Applications</gui>.
    You will then be able to use this application by right-clicking the file and
    selecting it from the list.</p></item>
  </steps>

  <p>This changes the default application not just for the selected file,
  but for all files with the same type.</p>
