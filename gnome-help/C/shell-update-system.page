  <title>Update Endless</title>

  <p>We are constantly working to improve Endless and will provide you with free
  system updates to help make your computer faster and easier to use.</p>

 <section>
  <title>If you have Wi-Fi or a wired internet connection</title>
    <p>New updates will be automatically downloaded to your computer when they
    become available. When the download is complete, you will see a notification
    that asks you to restart your computer to finish the installation process.
    You can restart your computer when you first see the notification, or at a
    later time. When your computer restarts, it will have the newest version of
    Endless!</p>

        your screen, then click on <gui>Settings</gui>.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
          <p>Click on <gui>Settings</gui> and then click on the

          updates, you can choose to download and install them.</p>
      </item>
    </steps>

    <note>
        <p>Make sure you don't go over your data limit! You may want to wait
        until you can get a Wi-Fi or wired internet connection. You can also
