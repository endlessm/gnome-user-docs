<title>I can't connect my Bluetooth device</title>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a
Bluetooth device, such as a phone or headset.</p>

<terms>
  <item>
    <title>Connection blocked or untrusted</title>
    <p>Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to change
    a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your device is set
    up to allow connections.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Bluetooth hardware not recognized</title>
    <p>Your Bluetooth adapter/dongle may not have been recognized by the computer.
    This could be because <link xref="hardware-driver">drivers</link> for the
    adapter aren't installed. Some Bluetooth adapters aren't supported on Linux,
    so you may not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case, you
    will probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.</p>

    <title>Adapter not switched on</title>
      <if:choose>
        <if:when test="platform:unity">
          <p>Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Click the
          Bluetooth icon in the <gui>menu bar</gui> and check that it's not
          <link xref="bluetooth-turn-on-off">disabled</link>.</p>
        </if:when>
        <p>Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Open the
        Bluetooth panel and check that it's not
        <link xref="bluetooth-turn-on-off">disabled</link>.</p>
      </if:choose>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Device Bluetooth connection switched off</title>
    <p>Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you're trying to connect
    to, and that it is
    <link xref="bluetooth-visibility">discoverable or visible</link>. For
    example, if you're trying to connect to a phone, make sure that it's not in
    airplane mode.</p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>No Bluetooth adapter in your computer</title>
    <p>Many computers do not have Bluetooth adapters. You can buy an adapter if
    you want to use Bluetooth.</p>

    <p>Add link to shell-terminology definition of system status *area* of top
    bar when it has been written, explain that if your network connection is
    through a bluetooth device it will show up in the system status *menu*.</p>
