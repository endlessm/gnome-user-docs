    <desc>Laptops go to sleep when you close the lid, in order to save
    power.</desc>

  <title>Why does my computer turn off when I close the lid?</title>

  <p>When you close the lid of your laptop, your computer will
  <link xref="power-suspend"><em>suspend</em></link> in order to save power.
  This means that the computer is not actually turned off - it has just gone to
  sleep. You can resume it by opening the lid. If it does not resume, try
  clicking the mouse or pressing a key. If that still does not work, press the
  power button.</p>

  <p>Some computers are unable to suspend properly, normally because their
  hardware is not completely supported by the operating system (for example,
  the Linux drivers are incomplete). In this case, you may find that you are
  unable to resume your computer after you have closed the lid. You can try to
  <link xref="power-suspendfail">fix the problem with suspend</link>, or you
  can prevent the computer from trying to suspend when you close the lid.</p>

  <title>Stop the computer from suspending when the lid is closed</title>

  <note style="important">
    <p>These instructions will only work if you are using <app>systemd</app>.
    Contact your distribution for more information.</p>
  </note>

  <p>If you do not want the computer to suspend when you close the lid, you can
  change the settings for that behavior. You will need to have an
  <link xref="user-admin-change">administrator password</link> to change the
  setting.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Be very careful if you change this setting. Some laptops can overheat
    if they are left running with the lid closed, especially if they are in
    a confined place like a backpack.</p>
  </note>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Open the <app>Terminal</app> application from the
      <gui>Activities</gui> overview.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Run the following command:</p>
      <screen its:translate="no"><output style="prompt">$</output> <input>sudoedit /etc/systemd/logind.conf</input></screen>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You will now see the contents of the file. Look for
      <code>HandleLidSwitch=</code> in the file. The line may be quoted out
      with a <code>#</code> at the start and may be followed by an argument. If
      the line already exists, unquote it. Otherwise, add the line.</p>
      <code>
[Login]
HandleLidSwitch=<input>lock</input>
      </code>
      <p>You can use <input>lock</input> for the screen to lock,
      <input>ignore</input> for nothing to happen, <input>poweroff</input> for
      the computer to switch off or <input>suspend</input> to suspend. For more
      information, see <link href="man:logind.conf">logind.conf help</link>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Once you finish editing the file, save your changes and quit the
      editor.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Run the following command to make your change work:</p>
      <screen its:translate="no"><output style="prompt">$</output> <input>sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service</input></screen>
      <p>If you do not run that command, the change will only work after your
      computer is restarted.</p>
