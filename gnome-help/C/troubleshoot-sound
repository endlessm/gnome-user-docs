  <title>Troubleshoot sound on your computer</title>
 
  <p>Here are some known issues and how to fix them if you're having trouble 
  hearing sound from your computer.</p>

  <title>Hearing sound on an old TV</title>
      <p>Some Endless computers are compatible with old TVs. To play audio 
      through your TV, you will need to use an adapter that connects your 
      TV too the 3.5 mm audio jack on the side of your computer. Endless 
      does not come with this adapter, so you should check with your local 
      electronics retailer to purchase one.</p>
