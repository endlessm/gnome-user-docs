  <title>Install apps that don't come on Endless</title>

  <p>Currently, it is not possible to install apps outside of the <gui>App
  Store</gui>. Luckily, Endless comes with a lot of great, and free, apps for
  you to install and explore!</p>

  <p>If you have a specific app that you would like to see on Endless in the
  future, please <link xref="gs-give-feedback">send us a message through the
  Feedback option</link> so that we know.</p>
