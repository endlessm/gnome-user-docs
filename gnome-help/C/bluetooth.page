<title>Bluetooth</title>

<p>Bluetooth allows you to connect many different types of devices to your
computer. It's commonly used for connecting wireless mouses and keyboards. You
can also use it to send files between devices, such as from your computer to
your cell phone, or vice versa.</p>

<p>You can turn Bluetooth on to connect to other Bluetooth devices, or you can
turn it off to conserve power.</p>
