<title>Connect to a VPN</title>

<p>A VPN (or <em>Virtual Private Network</em>) is a way of connecting to a
 local network over the internet. For example, say you want to connect to the
 local network at your workplace while you're on a business trip. You would
 find an internet connection somewhere (like at a hotel) and then connect to
 your workplace's VPN. It would be as if you were directly connected to the
 network at work, but the actual network connection would be through the
 hotel's internet connection. VPN connections are usually <em>encrypted</em>
 to prevent people from accessing the local network you're connecting to
 without logging in.</p>

<p>There are a number of different types of VPN. You may have to install some
 extra software depending on what type of VPN you're connecting to. Find out
 the connection details from whoever is in charge of the VPN and see which
 <em>VPN client</em> you need to use. Then, go to the software installer
 application and search for the <app>NetworkManager</app> package which works
 with your VPN (if there is one) and install it.</p>

<note>
 <p>If there isn't a NetworkManager package for your type of VPN, you will
 probably have to download and install some client software from the company
 that provides the VPN software. You'll probably have to follow some different
 instructions to get that working.</p>
</note>

<p>Once that's done, you can set up the VPN connection:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click on the System Menu at the very bottom left-hand corner of your
      screen and select the <gui>Settings</gui> button.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <gui>Network</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>At the bottom of the list on the left, click the <key>+</key> button
      to add a new connection.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Choose <gui>VPN</gui> in the interface list.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Choose which kind of VPN connection you have.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Fill in the VPN connection details, then press <gui>Add</gui> once you
      are finished.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>When you have finished setting-up the VPN, click the system status
      area on the top bar, click <gui>VPN</gui> and select the connection you
      just created. You may need to enter a password for the connection before
      it is established. Once the connection is made, you will see a lock
      shaped icon in the top bar.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Hopefully you will successfully connect to the VPN. If not, you may
      need to double-check the VPN settings you entered. You can do this from
      the <gui>Network</gui> panel that you used to create the connection,
      select the VPN connection from the list, then press the button in the
      bottom right corner of the panel.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>To disconnect from the VPN, click the system status area on the top
      bar and click <gui>Turn Off</gui> under the name of your VPN
      connection.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>
