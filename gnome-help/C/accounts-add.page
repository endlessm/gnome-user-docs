  <title>Add an account</title>

  <p>Adding an account will help link your online accounts with your Endless
  desktop. Thus, your email program, chat program and other related
  applications will be set up for you.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Click the <key>+</key> button in the lower-left portion of the
      window.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the type of account which you want to add.</p>
      <p>If you want to add more than one account type, you can do so at a
      later time.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>A small website window will open where you can enter your online
      account credentials. For example, if you are setting up a Google account,
      enter your Google username and password.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>If you have entered your credentials correctly, you will be prompted
      to allow Endless access to your online account. Authorize access to
      continue.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select the applications that you want linked to your online account.
      For example, if you want to use an online account for chat, but do not
      want to use an online account for your calendar, turn the
      <gui>Calendar</gui> option to <gui>Off</gui>.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

  <p>After you have added the accounts, each application that you have selected
  will automatically use those credentials when you start them.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>For security reasons, Endless will not store your password on your
    computer. Instead, it stores a token that is provided by the online
    service. If you want to fully revoke the link between your desktop and the
    online service, <link xref="accounts-remove">remove</link> it.</p>
