  <title>Use different speakers or headphones</title>

  <p>You can use external speakers or headphones with your computer. Speakers
  usually either connect using a circular TRS (<em>tip, ring, sleeve</em>) plug
  or a USB.</p>

  <p>If your speakers or headphones have a TRS plug, plug it into the
  appropriate socket on your computer. Most computers have two sockets: one for
  microphones and one for speakers. This socket is usually light green in color
  or is accompanied by a picture of headphones. Speakers or headphones
  plugged into a TRS socket are usually used by default. If not, see the
  instructions below for selecting the default device.</p>

  <p>Some computers support multi-channel output for surround sound. This
  usually uses multiple TRS jacks, which are often color-coded. If you are
  unsure which plugs go in which sockets, you can test the sound output in the
  sound settings.</p>

  <p>If you have USB speakers or headphones, or analog headphones plugged into
  a USB sound card, plug them into any USB port. USB speakers act as separate
  audio devices, and you may have to specify which speakers to use by
  default.</p>
