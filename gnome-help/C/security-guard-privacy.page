  <p><gui>The Lock Screen</gui></p>

  <p> Activating the lock screen when you step away from your computer allows
  you to keep all of your open programs running so you can resume your work more
  quickly when you return, without worrying that others will be able to access
  your workspace while you're gone. The lock screen also provides the following
  useful information:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>the name of the logged-in user</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>date and time, and certain notifications</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>battery and network status</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>the ability to control media playback - change the volume, skip a track
      or pause your music without having to enter a password</p>
    </item>
  </list>
  <p>To unlock your computer, just enter your password.</p>

  <note>
    <p>You can change the lock screen settings under the <gui>Privacy</gui>
    section in the <gui>Settings</gui> folder that you can access from the Start
    Menu on the very bottom left-hand side of your screen.</p>
