  <title>Play my videos</title>

  <p>Endless comes with some short videos already installed and a media player
  to play them. In order to watch a DVD you already have, you will need to
  connect an external DVD player to your computer (ask your local electronics
  retailer for more information on purchasing this accessory), and then you can
  use the same media player already installed to watch it. You can also download
  videos from the internet if you have a connection using the
  <app>FrostTorrent</app> app.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To watch your videos:</title>
      <p>You may have recorded videos on your phone, or have some videos on a
      USB stick that you want to watch. You'll first need to download them to
      your computer. You can do this simply by plugging in your device and
      dragging the video files into the <gui>Videos</gui> folder, or any other
      folder you prefer. Then, follow these directions:</p>
    <item>
      <p>Click on <media its:translate="no" type="image" mime="image/png"
      src="figures/eos-icon-documents.png"><gui>Documents</gui></media> on your
      desktop.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
       <p>Click on the <gui>Videos</gui> folder.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Browse the video files available. When you are ready to watch one, simply
      double click on the file.</p>
      <p>Your video will start to play automatically. You can control it within
      the app and choose to pause it, fast forward, or rewind it with the
      controls on the bottom left corner.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Make the video full screen by pressing the diagonal arrows next to the
      control buttons.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

    <p>Remember, you need to connect some headphones or speakers to be able to
    listen to the videos. If your computer is connected to a TV, the sound
    should work. </p>
