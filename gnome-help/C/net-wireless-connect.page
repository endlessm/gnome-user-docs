<title>Connect to a wireless network</title>

<p>You can connect to a wireless network to gain access to the internet,
 view shared files on the network, and so on.</p>

<steps>
  <item>
    <p>On the task bar on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, click
    the network icon <media type="image" mime="image/svg"
    src="figures/network-offline-symbolic.svg"/>.</p>
    <media its:translate="no" type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/eos-desktop-no-connection.png"/>
  </item>

  <item>
    <p>Click <gui>Wi-Fi</gui> to turn it <gui>ON</gui>. It will become blue to
    indicate Wi-Fi is ON.</p>
    <media its:translate="no" type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/eos-desktop-wifi-switch.png"/>
  </item>

  <item>
    <p>Click the name of the network you want to connect to.</p>
    <p>If the name of the network isn't in the list, try clicking
    <gui>More</gui> to see if the network is further down the list. If you still
    don't see the network, you may be out of range or the network 
    <link xref="net-wireless-hidden">might be hidden</link>.</p>
    <media its:translate="no" type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/eos-desktop-wifi-list.png"/>
  </item>

  <item><p>If the network is protected by a password
 (<link xref="net-wireless-wepwpa">encryption key</link>), enter the password
 when prompted and click <gui>Connect</gui>.</p>
  <p>If you do not know the password, it may be written on the underside of the
 wireless router or base station, in its instruction manual, or you may have to
 ask the person who administers the wireless network.</p></item>
  <item><p>The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to
 connect to the network.</p></item>

  <item><p>While the computer attempts to connect to the network, the network
  icon will look like this <media type="image" mime="image/svg"
  src="figures/network-wireless-acquiring-symbolic.svg"/>.</p></item>

  <item>
   <p>If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with
   several bars above it <media type="image" mime="image/svg"
  src="figures/network-wireless-signal-excellent-symbolic.svg"/>. More
   bars indicate a stronger connection to the network. If there aren't many
   bars, the connection is weak and might not be very reliable.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<p>If the connection is not successful, you may be asked for your password again
 or it might just tell you that the connection has been disconnected. There are
 a number of things that could have caused this to happen. You could have
 entered the wrong password, the wireless signal could be too weak, or your
 computer's wireless card might have a problem, for example.</p>

<p>A stronger connection to a wireless network does not necessarily mean that
 you have a faster internet connection, or that you will have faster download
 speeds. The wireless connection connects your computer to the <em>device which
 provides the internet connection</em> (like a router or modem), but the two
 connections are actually different, and so will run at different speeds.</p>
