  <note style="tip">
    <title>Tips:</title>
    <list>
      <item>
        <p>A song with more “Seeds” next to its name will download more
        quickly.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Files from SoundCloud.com, Archive.org, or other similar services,
        will not show any “Seeds” because they come directly from the source
        rather than from other FrostWire users.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Click the triangle button next to a file to preview it before
        downloading.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>Click the plus button next to a file to select the parts of the
        package that you want to download.</p>
      </item>
    </list>
  </note>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Make sure that what you are downloading is a legal copy! Many files have
    copyright laws that prohibit them from being shared for free online. This
    means that you could be sued for illegally downloading them without paying
    for them. That being said, there are millions of files that are completely
    legal and shareable on the internet, and that you can enjoy once you
    download them with this app. To learn more about downloading files and
    copyright, you may want to google "torrents and legality" so that you can
    make informed decisions on which files to download.</p>
