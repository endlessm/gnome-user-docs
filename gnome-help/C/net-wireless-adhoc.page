<title>Create a wireless hotspot</title>

<p>If you have a <link xref="net-wired-connect">wired connection</link>, you can
use your computer as a wireless hotspot. This allows other devices to connect to
you and allows you to share an internet connection or cellular network.</p>

<p>Things I'm not sure about: Is this actually ad-hoc? It seems to use the
same icon. What happens if you have multiple wireless adapters? Ought to be
able to share wireless to wireless, I think, but I don't know what the UI
looks like. Also, does any of this work? I couldn't successfully test.</p>
<p>Also, looks like there's no page to set the device name. Make one, then
link below where it says the name of the network is your device name.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click on the network status icon on the task bar at the very bottom
  right-hand corner of your screen.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click <gui>Network Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Click the <gui>Use as Hotspot...</gui> button.</p></item>
  <item><p>If you are already connected to a wireless network, you will be asked
  if you want to disconnect from that network. A single wireless adapter can
  connect to or create only one network at a time. Click
  <gui>Turn On</gui> to confirm.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>A network name (SSID) and security key are automatically generated.
The network name will be based on the name of your computer. Other devices
will need this information to connect to the hotspot you've just created.</p>

<note><p> It is not possible to connect to the internet via a wireless
connection while the hotspot is active.</p></note>
