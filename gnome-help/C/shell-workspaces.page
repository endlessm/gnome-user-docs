  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">Workspaces refer to the grouping of
  windows on your desktop. You can create multiple workspaces, which act like
  virtual desktops. Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop
  easier to navigate.</p>

  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">Workspaces refer to the grouping of
  windows on your desktop. You can use multiple workspaces, which act like
  virtual desktops. Workspaces are meant to reduce clutter and make the desktop
  easier to navigate.</p>

  <p>Workspaces can be used to organize your work. For example, you could have
  all your communication windows, such as e-mail and your chat program, on one
  workspace, and the work you are doing on a different workspace. Your music
  manager could be on a third workspace.</p>

<p>Using workspaces:</p>

<list>
 <item>
  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview,
  move your cursor to the right-most side of the screen.</p>
  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">Press the
  <key xref="keyboard-key-super">Super</key> key to open the
  <gui>Activities</gui> overview and then move your cursor to the right-most
  side of the screen.</p>
  </item>
 <item>
  <p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">A vertical panel will appear showing
  workspaces in use, plus an empty workspace. This is the 
  <link xref="shell-terminology">workspace selector</link>.</p>
  <p if:test="platform:gnome-classic">A vertical panel will appear showing
  available workspaces. This is the <link xref="shell-terminology">workspace
  selector</link>.</p>
 </item>
 <item if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p>To add a workspace, drag and drop a window from an existing workspace onto
  the empty workspace in the
  <link xref="shell-terminology">workspace selector</link>. 
  This workspace now contains the window you have dropped, and a new empty 
  workspace will appear below it.</p>
 </item>
 <item if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">
  <p>To remove a workspace, simply close all of its windows or move them to other
  workspaces.</p>
 </item>
</list>

<p if:test="!platform:gnome-classic">There is always at least one workspace.</p>
